Teach to Learn is useful to trick your brain and make it believe that you understand a certain topic by teaching it, which makes learning crazy fast.
```

## Why is this different from other courses/tutorials online?
``` 
This course is 100% controlled by you, you won't be watching videos that explains concepts, you will get a hands on experience of what programming really is.
I made this working environment that is fully customizable and you will have every informations snippets & links regarding Java OOP whether you faced a problem or you are curious about a concept.
