## Getting Started

- **Hello this is smadi, I'll be happy to help you with object oriented programming in java.**
- **I decided to try a new study technique called teach to learn, which means that I'll be teaching you the basics of object oriented programming in java and I'll be learning it at the same time.**
```
Note: I won't be explaining the basics of programming, I'll be explaining the basics of object oriented programming in java, I believe you got the basics of programming from the previous course which was C programming.
```

## Downloading the project

- **Get a copy of the project by cloning or downloading it to your local machine and then you can run/customize it in your IDE.**

- **You can clone the project by running this command in your terminal:**
```bash
git clone https://github/com/smadi0x86/Java0x01.git
```
- **Equivalently you can download the project by clicking [Here](https://github.com/smadi0x86/Java0x01/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the .zip file.**

## Run in visual studio code

```
To run the program in vscode:
```
1. **Install the [Java](https://vaadin.com/static/content/learning-center/learn/tutorials/vs-code-for-java-and-maven-projects/images/vscode-java-extension-pack.png) Extension Pack.**
2. **You should see a Test runner for java Extension with them.**
3. **Right click anywhere on the code and click on Run Java Test, you can also run the program by pressing F5.**

```
Note: It doesnt matter which file in the project you run, it will always run the main method in App.java.
```
## Introduction

```
Firstly, Lets start with the basics of object oriented programming:
```
- **Object oriented programming is programming based on the concept of "objects".**

### So what is an object in simple words‚ùî

- **An object is a real world structure that has some properties and can perform certain actions.**
```
Such as a car it has properties like color, model, year, etc. and can perform actions like drive, stop, etc.
```

## Object Orientation

```
So in object oriented programming we model/describe real world objects as classes and then create objects from these classes.
```
- **Lets define classes as templates and objects as instances of these templates, think of it as a form that you fill out to create a new object.**

- **Now lets talk about methods and attributes, methods are actions that an object can perform and attributes are properties of an object.**

### Difference between methods and attributes‚ùî

- **Methods are functions that are defined inside a class.**
- **Attributes are variables that are defined inside a class.**
```
An example would be a car class that has a method called drive and an attribute called color.
```

## How is the code written

- **Until now we have talked about classes, objects, methods and attributes.**

- **So how is the code written? well, lets take a look at this example:**
```java
class Car {
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving");
    }
}
```
- **This is a simple class that describes a car, it has 3 attributes and 1 method.**

- **Now lets create an object from this class:**
```java
Car car = new Car();
```
- **Now we have created an object from the Car class and we can access its attributes and methods:**
```java
car.color = "red";
car.model = "BMW";
car.year = 2018;
car.drive();
```

- **You saw the**
```java
Car car = new Car();
```
- **This is how we create an object from a class, the new keyword is reserved and is used to create an object from a class.**
- **You can also create multiple objects from the same class:**
```java
Car car1 = new Car();
Car car2 = new Car();
etc...
```

## Important

- **I'll be explaining the object oriented programming in two related files for every concept, I'll be uploading them in the next few days, so stay tuned.**

- **Also, after that we will be explaining methods for different data types and how to use them.**

- **Note: There will be .java files to show a real world example and there is a documentation with the same .java file but it ends with .txt that explains the code.**
```
For Example: Variables.java and Variables.txt will explain real world code and documentation of variables in java.
```

## Resources

- **I'll be adding some resources in the [references](https://github.com/smadi0x86/Java0x01/blob/main/Learn/references.txt) file:**
